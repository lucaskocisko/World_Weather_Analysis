# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this chapter is to help clients plan their travel destinations. I'll use APIs to help them in their decision.
### process
- I cleaned the starting data (.csv)
- Made API using openweathermap/ retrieved and store values from JSON arrays
- Generated appropriate visualizations based on the data (and linear regression)
- create a heatmap using google maps API
- used nearby search to find lodging
- used directions to plan a route
